### README

# Hi, I'm Daniel ðŸ‘‹

I hold **Master's Degrees** in **Business Psychology** and **Psychology**. Throughout my studies, I gained knowledge in areas such as **statistics**, **quantitative and qualitative data analysis**, and **R programming**. 

Currently, I work as an **Analyst** at **Statista**, where I primarily use **Excel** and **project management tools** like **Asana** to organize and manage my work. 

My ultimate goal is to transition into a career as a **Data Scientist**, which is why I am actively learning **SQL** and **Python** programming.

On my GitHub, you'll find a collection of my **coding projects** where I explore and apply my skills.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tr%C3%BCby-daniel-533186301/).
